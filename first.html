                    [Verse 1: SZA]
                    Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
                    Get some air now, let yo edge out
                    Too soon, I spoke
                    You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
                    I need rest now, got me bummed out
                    You so, you so, you
                    Baby, baby, babe
                    I've been on my empty mind shit
    
                    Open your heart up
                    Hoping I'll never find out that you're anyone else
                    'Cause I love you just how you are
                    And hope you never find out who I really am
                    'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me
                    You'll never love me but, I believe you when you say it like that
                    Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?
                    Oh, I believe you when you say it like dat
                    You must really love me
                    
                    You don't got shit to say to me
                    I ain't got shit to say to you
                    [Laughs] Granny, and that's the truth
                    And step on
                    Also you black heffa, you stand your ground
                    'Cause I feel the same way
                    If you don't like me, you don't have to fool with me
                    You don't have to talk about me or treat me mean
                    I don't have to treat you mean
                    I just stay out of your way
                    That's the way you work that one

                    I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
                    I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
                    You don't care
                    Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"
                    Tryna make sense of loose change
                    Got me a war in my mind
                    Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
                    Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me
            
                    Need you for the old me, need you for my sanity
                    Need you to remind me where I come from
                    Can you remind me of my gravity?
                    Ground me when I'm tumblin', spiralin', plummetin' down to Earth
                    You keep me down to Earth
                    Call me on my bullshit
                    Lie to me and say my booty gettin' bigger even if it ain't
                    Love me even if it rain
                    Love me even if it pain you
                    I know I be difficult
                    You know I be difficult
