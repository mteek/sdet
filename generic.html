                    I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
                    I touch on you more and more every time,
                    When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
                    Call your name two three times in a row,

                    Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
                    How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
                    'Cause I know I don't understand,
                    Just how your love can do what no one else can.

                    Got me looking so crazy right now,
                    Your love's got me looking so crazy right now

                    Your touch got me looking so crazy right now

                    Your touch got me hoping you'll page me right now,
                    Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
                    Looking so crazy
                    Your love's got me looking, got me looking so crazy
                    Your love.

                    If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress,

                    It's the way that you know what I thought I knew,
                    It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you,
                    But I still don't understand,
